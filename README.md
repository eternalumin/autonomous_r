# autonomous_r
Bare-metal firmware for the ARM Cortex-M4F TM4C123 microcontroller, developed and validated in Keil ÂµVision5 debug environment. The project demonstrates modular embedded design for autonomous robot control, including motor control logic, sensor input handling, and interrupt-driven decision-making.
